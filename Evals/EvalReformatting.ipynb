Similarly, I thought about [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) with [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), but that needs a working LaTeX environment to produce PDFs.\n",

The first (called \"RawData\") contains columns like \"Path\" \"CourseCode\" etc. and then \"Question_1\", \"Question_2\" etc. The second (called \"QuestionMapper\") contains \"Question 1\" etc. in column A and the text of the question in column B.\n",
